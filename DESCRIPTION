Description: This is data fusion algorithm for prioritising reliable associations between SNVs and traits.
    This algorithm, called Corrected Non-negative Matrix Factorization (cNMTF),  allows for studying the effect of single nucleotide variants on categorical traits, thanks to its main features :
    1) It captures the interrelatedness between variants data, the SNVs deleteriousness effect and the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that might be disrupted.
    2) It simultaneously accounts for the patient's outcome and ancestry by means of kernels functions, minimizing the confounding for population structures.
